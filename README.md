Pusheen Chess
=============

This is a chess implementation written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and inspired by [Pusheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusheen).


## Technologies

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Redux Zero](https://github.com/concretesolutions/redux-zero)


## Setup

This uses non-ejected create-react-app, so all you should need to do is clone the repo, run `yarn`, and `yarn start` to start the local server. All the create-react-app commands will work.


## Illustrations

Illustrations for this project were drawn in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). You can find the original Figma document [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Bf6TX3ob9FURz705vm7IaSCt/Pusheen-Chess-Pieces).
